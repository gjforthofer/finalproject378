{"title":"A Poem","markdown":{"yaml":{"title":"A Poem","format":"html"},"headingText":"The Call","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\n\n\n\nIn halls of might where young cadets aspire,\nA mind enthralled by numbers and by thought\nTakes flight in codes and queries that require\nA meld of truths that science and arts have brought.\nThis youth, whose dreams in dual majors lie,\nPhilosophy and data's woven threads,\nFinds beauty where the data points comply,\nAnd deeper truths where Socrates once treads.\n\"O duty,\" cries the heart wrapped in Air Force blue,\n\"To serve, to fly, to understand, to know!\"\nEach theorem proved, each ethic held as true,\nAs data streams like rivers onward flow.\nIn skies and scripts, his twin desires blend,\nTo keep the peace, his knowledge must extend.\n\n## Ethics of the Skies\n\nUpon the cloud-cast heights, our hero ponders\nThe moral weights that balance war and peace.\nThrough Python loops and logical meanders,\nHe seeks the good, his quest shall never cease.\nThe drone's cold eye, aloft by his command,\nSurveys the earth, collects the shadowed data.\n\"Shall this be just?\" he asks, and stays his hand,\nPhilosophy his guide, ever pro rata.\nFor Aristotle’s virtues in him reside,\nWith Plato's forms, he molds the binary sea.\nIn every byte and bit, he must decide\nThe path of justice, tech-forged liberty.\nIn algorithms’ chains and ethics’ lore,\nHe fights not wars, but for a world restored.\n\n## The Challenge of Dualism\n\n'Twixt abstract realms and terra's firm resolve,\nOur cadet strides with dual-burdened grace.\nTo solve the world, his complex codes evolve,\nYet pausing oft to question data’s place.\nDo numbers hold the key to timeless truths?\nCan Socratic debate refine raw facts?\nWithin his youthful breast, these quests, forsooth,\nCompel his march, his academic acts.\nHe codes, he queries, data sets to parse,\nThen turns to ponder existential themes.\nA balance struck 'twixt stars, his course to chart,\nThrough stormy ethics and data streams.\nThus robed in blue, beneath the wide sky’s dome,\nHe seeks to cipher truth, and find his home.\n\n## Data’s Might, Philosophy’s Insight\n\nFrom bytes arise the shapes of war and peace,\nWhile Plato’s cave reflects on shadows cast.\nIn data’s might, he seeks a sweet release,\nYet questions stir, by philosophy amassed.\nWith every graph, a new idea takes flight,\nA theory formed from structured query’s lore.\nYet, in his soul, the ancient texts alight,\nEach page a world, each word a closing door.\n\n## The Cadet’s Reflection\n\nAmidst the stars, a student stands alone,\nWith Aristotle's ethics as his guide.\nThe cosmos vast, a universe unknown,\nYet from his code, no secret shall abide.\nPhilosophy and science, hand in hand,\nChart courses true through data’s endless land.\n\n## The Virtue of the Code\n\nTo know oneself through numbers and through thought,\nOur cadet finds his virtue in the code.\nThe algorithms that his hands have wrought,\nIn lines where once the Stoics’ wisdom flowed.\nHe measures not in miles but in resolve,\nEach data set a step towards the good.\nIn loops recursive, mysteries dissolve,\nAs through the bits, the truths are understood.\n\n## The Battle of the Mind\n\nIn simulation’s realm, the battles wage,\nNot swords, but data, clash in silent storm.\nHe analyzes outcomes, page by page,\nWhere virtual conflicts in arrays transform.\nYet in his heart, the ancient battles ring,\nOf ethics, duty, where the muses sing.\n\n## The Solace of the Skies\n\nAbove, the endless skies offer solace,\nBelow, the code provides the deepest quest.\nHis mind in flight, beyond the earth’s embrace,\nFinds peace within the data’s ordered zest.\nYet still he turns to ancient scripts to seek\nThe moral paths that science cannot speak.\n\n## The Dual Path\n\nA path divided, yet by choice entwined,\nWhere logic meets the moral undertone.\nHis journey's marked by proofs both strict and kind,\nAs through the cypher's maze, his thoughts are sown.\nThis dual path, with steps both firm and sure,\nLeads him to truths both scientific and pure.\n\n## The Hour of Decision\n\nAn hour comes when decisions must be made,\nBetween the zero and the one defines.\nThe weight of consequence in numbers laid,\nAnd in his mind, the moral balance lines.\nFor every action, data can predict,\nBut human hearts must choose the script’s strict dict.\n\n## The Ethical Algorithm\n\nHe crafts an algorithm, ethics bound,\nWhere data’s flow and human values meet.\nIn lines of code, the moral grounds are found,\nA harmony where art and science greet.\nThus he encodes not just in binary,\nBut in the values of a wider query.\n\n## Night Studies\n\nBy candlelight, the cadet’s eyes are drawn\nTo ancient texts, while screens glow softly near.\nHe studies till the breaking of the dawn,\nIn dual worlds, his mission ever clear.\nThe wisdom of the past, the present’s edge,\nTogether weave through his nightly pledge.\n\n## Leadership’s Load\n\nWith leadership, a heavy mantle worn,\nHe guides his peers through data’s thickets wide.\nA captain not by rank, but by the horn\nOf plenty that his dual studies provide.\nIn him, a beacon bright, both old and new,\nTo light the way, to guide his crew true.\n\n## The Data Pilgrim\n\nA pilgrim in the realms of 1 and 0,\nIn digital domains his spirit soars.\nYet grounded by philosophy’s firm tow,\nAmongst the data streams his intellect roars.\nThis journey long, with electronic maps,\nGuided by ethics, through information gaps.\n\n## The Philosopher-Coder\n\nThe philosopher-coder stands in thought,\nBetween the if and then, the cause and clause.\nHis logic tight, his dialectics taught,\nIn every line, he seeks the greater cause.\nFor not in haste are data’s secrets won,\nBut in the thoughtful pause, the deed is done.\n\n## Graduation’s Dawn\n\nThe dawn of graduation casts its light,\nA new horizon stretches wide and far.\nThe cadet stands, prepared for future’s fight,\nEquipped with code, with ethics as his star.\nHis capstone project, a blend of two domains,\nA testament to where his passion reigns.\n\n## The Future’s Call\n\nBeyond the gates of USAFA’s halls,\nThe future calls, a vast uncharted script.\nWith data’s tools and ethics’ steadfast walls,\nInto the world’s complex code he’s dipped.\nHis journey’s not confined to solo flights,\nFor in his heart, philosophy ignites.\n\n## The Algorithm’s Edge\n\nWith every algorithm’s edge refined,\nHe crafts a world where data dares to serve.\nNot master but a tool, by ethics lined,\nTo ensure freedom’s curve does not unnerved.\nThrough binary seas, his steady course is kept,\nWith Socratic sails, forever adept.\n\n## The Quest Continues\n\nThough schooled and skilled, the quest is never done,\nFor learning is a lifelong code to crack.\nEach day brings forth a new challenge, spun\nFrom endless data, black on endless black.\nYet with each challenge, wisdom’s light grows bright,\nGuiding through the data’s darkest night.\n\n## The Cadet’s Creed\n\nTo live by codes, both moral and machine,\nTo serve with heart, with byte, with might, with mind,\nThis is the creed where his convictions lean,\nIn every binary choice, his truth to find.\nFor though the airman’s blue may fade to black,\nThe cadet’s spirit knows no single track.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n\n## The Call\n\nIn halls of might where young cadets aspire,\nA mind enthralled by numbers and by thought\nTakes flight in codes and queries that require\nA meld of
